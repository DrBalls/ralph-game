## Tips

- `USE X WITH Y` and `USE X ON Y` are interchangeable — use whichever feels natural
- `EXAMINE` everything — lots of flavor text and hints
- `TALK TO` characters multiple times for different dialogue
- `EXAMINE SELF` for a humorous self-description
- You can examine items in your inventory, not just things in the room
- Save frequently with `SAVE 1/2/3`
- The artifact is surprisingly sarcastic for an ancient cosmic entity
- Duct tape really does fix everything
