# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-28

## Codebase Patterns
- Game engine modules go in src/engine/ (Room.js, Item.js, Parser.js, etc.)
- Room/item data files go in src/data/
- UI modules go in src/ui/
- Pixel art images go in public/images/
- This is a vanilla JavaScript browser game - no build step required
- Use ES6 modules with import/export
- Game runs by opening index.html in a browser
- Start local server with: `cd public && python3 -m http.server 8080`

## 2026-01-28 - US-001
- **What was implemented:** Project setup and directory structure
- **Files changed:**
  - public/index.html - Game UI with intro screen, image panel, text output, command input
  - public/styles.css - Retro VGA-style aesthetics with pixel fonts, CRT effect
  - public/game.js - Main entry point with basic command handling (LOOK, INVENTORY, HELP)
  - prd.json - Project definition with 51 user stories
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HTML uses type="module" for ES6 module support
  - The intro screen overlay hides with classList.add('hidden')
  - output() function appends p elements to #game-output
  - handleCommand() will be refactored to use Parser class in US-005
  - Placeholder room description hardcoded - will be replaced by Room class in US-002
